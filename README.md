                                Description

Species is a multi-platform application developed with React Native using the pokeapi API where we can obtain information about Pokemons, in which each Pokemon is shown with its characteristics, it also has a Log in system using Formik and Yup with which the user can add to Favorites the Pokemons that the user likes the most and store them in the user account, we used Navigation to be able to navigate between screens and have a better connectivity between them.
